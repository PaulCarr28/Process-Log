Over the past week I was of course working on the game jam. During that process I learned about post-process effects in Unreal, utilizing inheritance to make work easier, and just general experience with the engine and troubleshooting bugs.

I also learned alot about how the development cycle works, from creating a game to finishing it. Me and my team learned a lot as our roles became a lot more defined through the development process. 


As for after jam stuff, today I focused on refocusing on developing Tiny Titans. I discussed with the team art direction, coming to the conclusion that controls will the 3D assets, almost like being inside the mech. Health is primarily going to 
be shown using visuals queues such as how the mech looks, as opposed to something like a health bar. We determined which maps we're exactly going to be making as well. Cameron and Keon are going to work on a general design for the mechs so we
can keep that consistent. The focus now is to build a functioning game before working on stuff like the garage.
