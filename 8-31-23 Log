Over the past couple of days I have continued focusing on learning Unreal Engine. I started by finishing the tutorial I was watching on how to make a basic 3rd person character. 
This saw me learning about a variety of things, such as adding components to assemble a character, using Unreal’s Enhanced Movement subsystem to make the character move, adding inputs and then defining them in blueprints, and even learned a little about how to set up animations. 

After finishing that tutorial I followed another about how to make a character shoot a projectile. From this I learned that Unreal has a built in system for making projectiles, and most features could be defined in the details menu. I then learned how to make it so when I pressed left-click, the projectile would shoot, learning a little blueprint logic along the way. 

After doing both of these I sort of tested myself by trying to make a 3rd-person character that could shoot without using tutorials as much as possible. The idea here being that going through 
the process on my own would cement it in my brain and allow me to fill any gaps. For example; I forgot how to enable the Enhanced Movement subsystem for my character within Blueprints, something that I now have down as a result of this “test”. 

I also spent time on more managerial tasks, such as setting up a GitHub repository. This saw me spending time reading about Git and GitHub to learn the basics about how they work. I created the repository (with some help from Mr. Compton) and then added the project files to it. Currently I have requested that my team give me their GitHub usernames so I can add them to the project.
