Today I started by finishing up a small side project I started on Thursday, which was trying to implement a Diablo-style movement system (I recently got addicted to Diablo). For this side project, I referenced Epic’s top-down framework to see how they did it. By doing this, I learned more about the Enhanced Input system in Unreal, as well as about Game Modes and Player Controllers. One thing that I saw in Epic’s project was the code for the input and movement being put into the PC as opposed to the Character Blueprint. This seems like a good idea because it allows for far more versatility with controlling a bunch of different characters instead of just one. For the actual movement, I made a function called “Follow”. This takes a cahchedLocation, generated by a cursor hit, and then adds movement to the pawn by getting it, its location, and the direction and adding a movement input onto that.

After that little side project, I worked on adding a camera to Table Titans. To do this, I simply created an actor that’s just a sphere with a camera attached to it. I then used a Game Mode to set it as the view when the game begins. I also added some other basic blueprints to build on later, such as a player controller and character blueprint. 

I also spent some time looking at the code for DohMansLand because I had some questions about how they did some things. I was most interested in how they did movement, which seems to consist of taking a touch input and then if that overlaps with a 3D object playing out the action. I don’t fully understand how this all works but I intend to.
