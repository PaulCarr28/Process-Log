Today, I did as asked, and read the fu--I mean fine manual. I mainly went through the “understanding the basics” as a point of review to see if there’s anything I missed. After reading through this I opted to peruse different parts of the manual so I didn’t fall asleep. I became fairly interested in what the manual had to say about blueprints, as trying to understand all of Unreal’s libraries is proving to be quite the undertaking. 

One point that has been interesting to me is casting. I was (and still sort of am) having a difficult time wrapping my head around what it does. Basically, as I understand it, when we cast to something, we run a check to see if our interaction is valid, and from there we can access the functionality of the object we cast to. I also learned about directly accessing an object using references.

It turns out that Unreal’s documentation also has some tutorials! I decided to follow the one on how to implement a damage system as that will prove useful in my game. I also dug through the code for the first person template, and looked at the way they did the gun pickup, as adding different components to an actor will probably prove useful in a game about building a custom mech.
