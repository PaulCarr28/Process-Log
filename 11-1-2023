Today I worked on implementing a targeting system for our game. I did this by first adding a sphere collision on our mech blueprint in order to facilitate detection of when enemies enter or exit our radius. When something enters, we check if its associated tags match with our mech, and if not we add them to our list of available targets. I also set up some logic to help manage our target when our list changes, so that we donâ€™t accidentally keep targeting someone when they exit our range. 

I also began work on setting up our firing logic. Since I want our mech to predict where its target might end up when moving so that all of our shots don't just miss, I did a little math to figure out where the enemy mech will be. I focused on calculating how far the enemy mech might move in the time it takes for a bullet to reach them, and the formula looks a little like (Distance = enemyVelocity * myFireRate * myBulletSpeed).
